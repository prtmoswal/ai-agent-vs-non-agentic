AI Agentic vs. Non-Agentic AI Comparison Platform
Developed an interactive Streamlit application demonstrating the core differences between Agentic and Non-Agentic AI behaviors, leveraging Hugging Face Transformers for Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Implemented offline LLM functionality by integrating distilgpt2 (a transformers model) for CPU-based execution, ensuring accessibility and functionality without internet dependency, optimized using @st.cache_resource.
Engineered a simplified AI agent capable of tool utilization (e.g., a calculator) to process specific queries (e.g., mathematical operations), showcasing the agent's ability to reason and execute external functions.
Designed a comparative user interface that presents side-by-side responses from both the direct LLM (non-agentic) and the tool-enhanced agentic AI, highlighting improved accuracy and capability.
Contributed to a practical educational resource for understanding foundational concepts in AI agent design and LLM deployment strategies.
